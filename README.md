#### Lists and for for loops
 - create a new python file for your homework
 - Create a list with 10 favorite films

Access the list:
 - print the film in position 1
 - print the film in position 3
 - print the film in position 7
 - print the film in position 9
 - Print the list (all of it)

Redefine an index: 
 - Change the film in position 3 to 
    - 'The Lion King'
 - print the film in position 3


Redefine an index with **user input**: 
 - request user input and keep it in a variable
 - Change the gift in position 3 to users input
 - print the gift in position 3

Loop over the list and print:
 - use a for loop to print each item individually


Loop over the list and print in formatted:
 - use a for loop to print each item
 - it should look like this but with **your individual times!**

```
    1 - Football
    2 - Candles
    3 - Socks
    ...
```

#### IF statements
